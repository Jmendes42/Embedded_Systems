#### BlinkBinary

This project consists of a simple bare-metal program that will light up LED's in a binary 8bit number fashion with the click of a button

For this project, my goals were:
  - To get rid of the Arduino IDE and start building my own projects using a Makefile to compile and upload code to Arduino development board.
  - Start getting comfortable using registers and bitwise operations.
