#### ClockTimer

This project series consist of bare-metal programs that use a four seven segment display to count seconds and minutes.

For this project, my goals were:

  - Get familiar with navigating the data sheet;
  - To get familiar with interrupts (ISR) and clock timers;
  - Get to know all the types of interrupts possible with timers;
  - Broaden my knowledge on registers and binary operations;
  - Conciliate both registers and timers;
  - Also got the opportunity to get familiar with the four seven segment display;

**Notes:**

1st version -> Timer Overflow:
  
  - Number configurations are in hexadecimal numeration in an array;
  - The ```sei()``` function enables the use of timers;
  - Timer 1 will be used on this exercise. To enable, just write 1 to the bit 0 (**TOIE1**) of **TIMSK1** register

  - To set the timer mode to overflow (normal mode), the following bits in **TCCR1A** and **TCCR1B** must be at 0 value:
    - **WGM10** and **WGM11** in **TCCR1A**;
    - **WGM12** and **WGM13** in **TCCR1B**;

  - The presacaler is set to 1024. This means that the frequency of the timer (16MHz) will be divided by the value 1024. To set this the **CS12** and **CS10** bits of **TCCR1B** must be set to 1.
